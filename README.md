# Day_Planner

The Day Planner activity was to create a day planner that showed the current date and had time blocks for the standard working hours of 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. 
The user is able to click into an activity block and type their schedule. 
The user is then able to save that specific time block value by clicking the save button. 
If the user refreshes, the data still exists in the time blocks specified. 
If the user wants to clear the data for a new day, they can simply press the clear schedule button. 
The time blocks will turn different colors depending on if the time is before, after or the same as the current hour, so the user can keep track of their day.
